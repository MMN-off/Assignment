        "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?<br>\n",

        "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?<br>\n",
        "Ans. The methods are remove(), pop() and clear(). It helps to remove the very first given element matching from the list. The pop() method removes an element from the list based on the index given. The clear() method will remove all the elements present in the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.<br>\n",
        "Ans. Both strings and lists have lengths: a string's length is the number of characters in the string; a list's length is the number of items in the list. Each character in a string as well as each item in a list has a position, also called an index.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What&#39;s the difference between tuples and lists?<br>\n",
        "Ans. The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which are mutable. Therefore, it is possible to change a list but not a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?<br>\n",
        "Ans. t= (42,)  # trailing comma is mandatory.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How do you get a list value&#39;s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value&#39;s list form?<br>\n",
        "Ans. To convert a tuple into list in Python, call list() builtin function and pass the tuple as argument to the function. list() returns a new list generated from the items of the given tuple\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Variables that &quot;contain&quot; list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they\n",
        "contain?<br>\n",
        "Ans. will contain references to list values\n",
        "\n",
        "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?<br>\n",
        "Ans. copy() create reference to original object. If you change copied object - you change the original object. . deepcopy() creates new object and does real copying of original object to new one. Changing new deepcopied object doesn't affect original object."
